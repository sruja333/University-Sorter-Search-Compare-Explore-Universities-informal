🎓 University Sorter — Search, Compare & Explore Universities

A fun side-project that turned into a fully functional university comparison tool.

🚀 Overview

University Sorter is a searchable, sortable, filter-friendly university comparison website.
Originally built as a playful project for a friend with personalized inside jokes, it evolved into a complete web application with modern UI features, cloud deployment, and data management.

This project demonstrates my skills in frontend development, animations, authentication, UI/UX, and deploying a production-ready web app.
